# Numerical-Methods-and-Economic-Simulation

This repo contains my own codes from the projects of the [Numerical Methods &amp; Economic Simulation](https://sigarra.up.pt/fep/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=480185) (NMES) course of my first semester of the Master's in Economics at the School of Economics of the University of Porto (FEP). The average grade of projects one and two was 19/20.

## Overview

This repo contains the folders of the two projects that must be done to complete the NMES course. There is a specific statement inside both folders regarding the instructions of the challenges. You can read it first to understand the requirements for each project.

Although GitHub states that the project was done with MATLAB, the software used to complete both projects was Octave (MATLAB's free brother).

## Credits
The projects could not be done without the assist of professor [Paulo Vasconcelos](https://sigarra.up.pt/fep/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=205391) and, mainly, professor [José Matos](https://sigarra.up.pt/fep/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=232211) which helped me with the transition probability matrix of the "...Markov_Chains" challenge in project 2.

I would also like to thank some colleagues such as Clara Silva, Luís Miranda, Pedro Freitas, and Telmo Teixeira for the fruitfull discussions about the projects.
